					The original host (<a href="http://thethreshold.com">Threshold
						Entertainment</a>) took it down, so you are probably unable to play
					this season on the official website any more. Fortunately,
					there are some other game websites who picked it up. Search for "arcane
					miller estate" and you'll find them. 
					</p>
					<p>
					At some points during the game, the flash files try to load some
					MIDI files as background music. But since the game is hosted by a
					third-party website, these MIDI files are usually missing. So you
					would see some pop-up windows saying "Page Not Found". Just ignore
					these errors, and the game is still playable. 
					</p>
					<p>
					Save/Load features may not work either, because they require a database
					on the server that stores information of ongoing games, which is hard
					for a third-party game website.
